Revision History
================
Version 1.2
+++++++++++
This version makes versioning the python much simpler. It allows for much easier modification to the RPiSoC code, without needing to version those changes in the python code. Instead, when a connection is established, the python will request specific compiled data from the RPiSoC and save it to a parent class for use by all objects.

New to v1.2.0
*************
	In the RPiSoC code
		- Added a way for the RPiSoC to scan its generated source to determine
			* What GPIO were being used
			* How many PWMs, analog pins, and capsense buttons are being used
			* If there existed one or more VDACs, IDACs, Delsig ADCs, SAR ADCs, or Wave DACs
			* The full scale ranges on any DACs that are found
			* The resolution of every PWM being used, as well as how many unique clocks are driving them
			* Details about exactly which PWMs are sharing specific clocks, and the source frequency and default divider placed on those clocks
		- That data was then packed appropriately so that it could easily and efficiently be sent to the Raspberry Pi on request
		- Changed the GPIO structure to support all possible GPIO, and removed the control/status registers which were previously writing to, and polling these GPIO. With this approach, modification is simplified and digital resources are reserved.
		- Added full support for up to 24 PWM channels (previously there was only support for 8)
		- Added support for 6 CapSense buttons, located on Port 4, pins 0-5, with P4[6] needing a ~2.2nF Cmod
		- Made a skeleton for UART support, but haven't yet completed the implementation
	In class *RPiSoC*
		- Added the ability to determine what is in the RPiSoC firmare during the construction of the object, inside of the *__new__* method
		- Added a DEBUG feature, which when set to *True* will print warnings and other diagnostic information to the terminal during run time
	In module *analog*
		- Added class *CapSense* with the following methods
			* Start() : Starts the CapSense component, and all sub-components, preparing them for operation
			* Stop()  : Disables CapSense components, and all sub-components, and puts them in their lowest power mode
			* Read()  : Returns the state of the desired CapSense button
	In class *Servo*
		- Fixed a bug which caused errors with 8-bit PWMs, due to a poorly derived (non-generalized) formula for calculation of a comparison value
	In all classes
		- Removed hard coded constraints, dependent on the version of the API, and replaced them with references to the data collected at construction of the RPiSoC object.
			* For instance, instead of raising an exception when you ask to initialize an analog pin not in range(10), as it was previously, I will raise an exception when trying to initialize an analog pin not in range(RPiSoC.ANALOG_IN_NUM), where RPiSoC.ANALOG_IN_NUM is the number of analog inputs which were discovered when the RPiSoC class was constructed. This makes the API more portable and easier to version.
	In classes *SPI* and *I2C*
		- Provided an optional second argument to the *receiveData()* method, which will accept a delay, in seconds, to be called between the write operation and read operation. This is to be used by advanced users expanding the API. If a feature they implement requires a highly complex operation to be executed on the RPiSoC, the Python may have to wait a small amount of time between the request and the response. Otherwise, a garbage response will be returned by the method.

Version 1.1
+++++++++++
This version provides the Pi with a lot more functionality, and use of the API is intended to be more flexible than in the previous version.

New to v1.1.2
*************
	In the RPiSoC code
		- Removed the second SAR ADC and replaced it with a sequenced ADC, with 10 analog inputs. This allows for simplified use of analog pins, and gives 10 more.
		- Removed Port 6 as a GPIO register so that more analog pins could be added
		- PWM (and consequently servo) pins were moved from Port 3 to Port 6, so that Port 3 could be used for the new analog pins (Ports 0 and 3 have slightly better analog performance than the other ports)
		- Changed the structure of the GPIO functionality enumeration. I concatenated all of the seperate GPIO registers into one register, and changed the packing and unpacking process of each transfer to contain the port, pin, command, and value to be written if applicable. 
		- Added the ability to change drive modes to each GPIO at run time.
	In module *rpisoc*
		- Fixed the import structure so that both smbus and spidev aren't needed. This means you don't have to configure the Pi for I2C if you only intend to use SPI, or vice versa. 
	In module *digital*
		- Removed classes *DigitalInput* and *DigitalOutput*
		- Added class *digitalPin* which allows one to instantiate any of the GPIO as input or output, or in any of several different drive modes if needed.
	In module *analog*
		- Added class *analogPin* which simplifies the process of getting an analog reading from an ADC, and it adds an aditional 10 analog inputs.
	In class *Servo*
		- Simplified instantiation. It is now only required to provide a servo location relative to Port 6.
			* Pulse width and angle ranges can still be input, but they will simply default to standard values if only the servo location is given
			* Minimum pulse width defaults to 1.0; maximum pulse width defaults to 2.0; minimum angle defaults to 0; maximum angle defaults to 180


New to V1.1.1
*************
	Code structure
		- communication.py was removed and merged with rpisoc.py to simplify the overall structure.	
	In class *SPI*
		- Further minimized latency inherent to each SPI transfer. 
		- *cleanup()* method will now reset any global data tracked within the RPiSoC class, in case cleanup is not called at termination (which is should be...)
	In class *I2C*
		- *cleanup()* method will now reset any global data tracked within the RPiSoC class, in case cleanup is not called at termination (which is should be...) 
	In class *VDAC*
		- Added a *SetVoltage()* method, so that the user can directly input a voltage within the specified DAC's full scale range
	In class *IDAC*
		- Added a *SetCurrent()* method, so that the user can directly input a current in milliamperes within the specified DAC's full scale range
	

New to V1.1.0
*************
	In the RPiSoC code
		- Added I2C support
		- Added the ability to software reset the RPiSoC through the Raspberry Pi
		- Removed unneeded delays, speeding up the init process
		- changed which bootloader is used
		- clocked the PWM's seperately, such that they aren't all sharing the same clock; they are only sharing their clock with one other PWM instead of 7, as was the case in *V1.0.0*
		- Fixed a bug discovered in the WaveDAC class, which was generating waves that appeared to be very noisy. 

	In class *PWM*
		- Added ability to modify the frequency of the clocks which drive the PWM signals
		- Added ability to read back the actual PWM clocking frequency.
		- Added a warning when the clock range of the PWM clocks might be innacurate (since the frequencies are generated using clock dividers, and they can be innacurate at high frequencies)
		- Changed the SetDutyCycle() method to be a float value instead of an int, for more precision
		- Added a GetDutyCycle() method which will give back the percentage of time between 0 and 100 how long your PWM is high.
		- Added a SetClockDivider() method which lets you give the PWM clock a specific divider value, so you don't have to be worried about an innacurate result using SetClocks()
		- Added a GetClockDivder() method to see what the most recently confirmed clock divider value is
		- Added the ability to modify the actual wave frequency of the PWM, between 0.006 Hz and 2.4MHz, without affecting the duty cycle too profoundly. 
		- Added a GetFrequency() method which will return the actual frequency of the PWM wave
		- Added class attributes to the RPiSoC class which indicate whether a register address is already in use. So if the user attempts to initialize an object that is already in use, a warning will be issued.

	In class *ADC*
		- Changed return value of CountsTo_Volts() method for the ADC's from a millivolt value to a microvolt value, so that precision is increased. The return value of the Python method when called is still in Volts.

	In classes *DigitalInput* and *DigitalOutput*
		- Moved the bit masking process of the digital inputs and outputs to the C code, where it can be executed more quickly, and with fewer data transfers
	
	In class *WaveDAC*
		- Added a warning when the frequency might be out of range
	In modeule *digital*
		- Added class *Servo* with the following methods:
			* SetPulse() : Sets a PWM pulse in milliseconds
			* ReadPulse(): Gets the actual pulse in milliseconds that is being applied to the servo
			* SetAngle() : sets the servomotor to a designated angle based on the user defined minimum angle, maximum angle, minimum pulse width, and maximum pulse width. 
			* ReadAngle(): Reads the actual angle based on the same parameter set as *SetAngle()*
			* Stop(): Stops the PWM signal which is driving the servo
			* Start(): Starts the PWM signal which will drive the servo


Version 1.0
+++++++++++
The public release of the API. It exposes, most fundamentally, the following functionality to the Raspberry Pi through the RPiSoC

	- 8 PWM channels
	- 20 digital outputs
	- 19 digital inputs
	- 2 8-bit VDAC's
	- 1 8-bit IDAC
	- 1 8-bit WaveDAC
	- 1 16-bit Delta Sigma ADC
	- 2 12-bit SAR ADC's

Communication to the RPiSoC requires use of SPI. No other communication protocol is yet supported, and the VDAC's and IDAC's are currently untested.
