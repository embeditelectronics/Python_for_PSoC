Revision History
================

Version 1.1
+++++++++++
This version provides the RPi with a lot more functionality, and use of the API is intended to be more flexible than in the previous version.

New to V1.1.1
*************
	Code structure
		- communication.py was removed and merged with rpisoc.py to simplify the overall structure.	
	In class *SPI*
		- Further minimized latency inherent to each SPI transfer. 
		- *cleanup()* method will now reset any global data tracked within the RPiSoC class, in case cleanup is not called at termination (which is should be...)
	In class *I2C*
		- *cleanup()* method will now reset any global data tracked within the RPiSoC class, in case cleanup is not called at termination (which is should be...) 
	In class *VDAC*
		- Added a *SetVoltage()* method, so that the user can directly input a voltage within the specified DAC's full scale range
	In class *IDAC*
		- Added a *SetCurrent()* method, so that the user can directly input a current in milliamperes within the specified DAC's full scale range
	

New to V1.1.0
*************
	In the RPiSoC code
		- Added I2C support
		- Added the ability to software reset the RPiSoC through the Raspberry Pi
		- Removed unneeded delays, speeding up the init process
		- changed which bootloader is used
		- clocked the PWM's seperately, such that they aren't all sharing the same clock; they are only sharing their clock with one other PWM instead of 7, as was the case in *V1.0.0*
		- Fixed a bug discovered in the WaveDAC class, which was generating waves that appeared to be very noisy. 

	In class *PWM*
		- Added ability to modify the frequency of the clocks which drive the PWM signals
		- Added ability to read back the actual PWM clocking frequency.
		- Added a warning when the clock range of the PWM clocks might be innacurate (since the frequencies are generated using clock dividers, and they can be innacurate at high frequencies)
		- Changed the SetDutyCycle() method to be a float value instead of an int, for more precision
		- Added a GetDutyCycle() method which will give back the percentage of time between 0 and 100 how long your PWM is high.
		- Added a SetClockDivider() method which lets you give the PWM clock a specific divider value, so you don't have to be worried about an innacurate result using SetClocks()
		- Added a GetClockDivder() method to see what the most recently confirmed clock divider value is
		- Added the ability to modify the actual wave frequency of the PWM, between 0.006 Hz and 2.4MHz, without affecting the duty cycle too profoundly. 
		- Added a GetFrequency() method which will return the actual frequency of the PWM wave
		- Added class attributes to the RPiSoC class which indicate whether a register address is already in use. So if the user attempts to initialize an object that is already in use, a warning will be issued.

	In class *ADC*
		- Changed return value of CountsTo_Volts() method for the ADC's from a millivolt value to a microvolt value, so that precision is increased. The return value of the Python method when called is still in Volts.

	In classes *DigitalInput* and *DigitalOutput*
		- Moved the bit masking process of the digital inputs and outputs to the C code, where it can be executed more quickly, and with fewer data transfers
	
	In class *WaveDAC*
		- Added a warning when the frequency might be out of range
	New class *Servo*
		- Added a servo class with the following methods:
			* SetPulse() : Sets a PWM pulse in milliseconds
			* ReadPulse(): Gets the actual pulse in milliseconds that is being applied to the servo
			* SetAngle() : sets the servomotor to a designated angle based on the user defined minimum angle, maximum angle, minimum pulse width, and maximum pulse width. 
			* ReadAngle(): Reads the actual angle based on the same parameter set as *SetAngle()*
			* Stop(): Stops the PWM signal which is driving the servo
			* Start(): Starts the PWM signal which will drive the servo


Version 1.0
+++++++++++
The public release of the API. It exposes, most fundamentally, the following functionality to the Raspberry Pi through the RPiSoC

	- 8 PWM channels
	- 20 digital outputs
	- 19 digital inputs
	- 2 8-bit VDAC's
	- 1 8-bit IDAC
	- 1 8-bit WaveDAC
	- 1 16-bit Delta Sigma ADC
	- 2 12-bit SAR ADC's

Communication to the RPiSoC requires use of SPI. No other communication protocol is yet supported, and the VDAC's and IDAC's are currently untested.
