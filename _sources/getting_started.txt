Getting Started
===============
Here is everything you should need to get yourself moving with development on the RPiSoC through the Raspberry Pi! 

.. _getting-started-rpisoc:

Using the RPiSoC
++++++++++++++++
If you're new to the RPiSoC, it would greatly benefit you to read through its documentation before going any further. The documentation can be found here:

- https://github.com/EmbeditElectronics/RPiSoC_Bootloader/blob/master/RPiSoC_RevC_User_Guide.pdf

Pay special attention to the sections discussing how to download a program to the board using the Bootloader Host Tool. 


Program your RPiSoC
+++++++++++++++++++
Once you know how to program the RPiSoC, you're ready to go! Just download the PSoC Creator project from git and download it to the RPiSoC. 

- https://github.com/EmbeditElectronics/psoc_2_pi/tree/master/PSoC%20Creator


.. _getting-started-rpi:

Using the RPiSoC with the Raspberry Pi
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The following is necessary set up the RPiSoC in the Raspberry Pi environment

.. _getting-started-git:

Download the Python files from git
----------------------------------
First, make sure that you have git installed on your raspberry Pi. From the terminal window::

	sudo apt-get install git-core

Then, create a folder for the RPiSoC API, and download it from git::

	git clone git://github.com/EmbeditElectronics/psoc_2_pi.git

And navigate into the Python folder to get started::

	cd API_Python_v_1_1

.. _getting-started-spi:

Configure SPI and download spidev
---------------------------------
Now, if you want to use all of the API on the Raspberry Pi, you will need to have the SPI bus enabled, and you will need to have the spidev libraries installed and in your working directory. 
Luckily, this is a very easy process. First though, you will need to do an update/upgrade on your pi. Open a new terminal window and enter the following  commands::

	sudo apt-get clean
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo reboot

Next, you will need to install the python-dev libraries, if they aren't already installed::

	sudo apt-get install python-dev

Now you need to enable the SPI bus on your Pi, which is disabled by default to speed up the boot process::

	sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf

This will bring up a text editor where you will find a line that reads::

	blacklist spi-bcm2708

Simply comment this line out by adding a *#* to the front of it, and reboot your pi:: 

	sudo reboot

Now, navigate to your working directory, the one with the API downloaded to it, and make a new directory for spidev::

	mkdir python-spi
	cd python-spi
	wget https://raw.github.com/doceme/py-spidev/master/setup.py
	wget https://raw.github.com/doceme/py-spidev/master/spidev_module.c
	sudo python setup.py install

And now SPI should be good to go!

.. _getting-started-i2c:

Configure I2C and download smbus
--------------------------------
To use I2C for your communications between RPi and RPiSoC, you will need to configure your i2c bus, similarly to how it was done for SPI.

Assuming you have done an update/upgrade recently, as you should have if you followed the previous step, you must now enable i2c. 
As was the case with SPI, I2C is disabled by the Pi by default. To change this, you must modify the blacklist again::

	sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf

Now change the line::
	
	blacklist i2c-bcm2708 
	
so that it instead reads::

	#blacklist i2c-bcm2708

Now you need to add the I2C module to the kernel::

	sudo nano /etc/modules

And you should add to the end of this file the following line::

	i2c-dev
	
Now you simply must install the needed packages::

	sudo apt-get install i2c-tools
	sudo apt-get install python-smbus

And to configure the software, you must add your username to the I2C access group. 
In this case I'll assume your username is *pi* so::

	sudo adduser pi i2c

Now reboot::

	sudo reboot

And when the pi boots back up, open the terminal, connect the RPiSoC with the program loaded, and test the i2c bus::

	i2cdetect -y 1

This should display dashed lines where no address was identified, except for where it found an address, and this should read *08* in the case of the RPiSoC API. If you do not see any results, try::

	i2cdetect -y 0

And if you see the 8, make sure to modify :meth:`__init__` of :class:`rpisoc.I2C` so that it reflects the usage of the correct bus.

If in either case you find that the address 0x3b is being used, and reflected by the appearance of *UU*, then try adding one of these three lines to your  blacklist::

	blacklist snd_soc_wm8804
	blacklist snd_soc_bcm2708_i2s
	blacklist snd_soc_pcm512x

This will disable the pi's native audio driver, i2s support, and the stereo DAC driver, in that order, but it is likely that blacklisting one of them will fix the problem. 

The final thing to change is the baudrate of the pi's I2C driver. 
I found that its default value was slightly error prone, and so I increased it, which resulted in error free results. 
To do this, you will need to create a config file in the modprobe.d folder; I called mine i2cbaud.conf. To create this file, simply enter into the terminal::

	sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/i2cbaud.conf
	
and add this single line to it from your text editor::

	options i2c_bcm2708 baudrate=500000
	
Now just reboot::

	sudo reboot
	
And you should be good to go!

.. _getting-started-computer:

Using the RPiSoC with your computer!
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
To use the RPiSoC on your PC, you will need to have the RPiSoC device driver installer, you will need python 2.7 installed, your system will need to have python added to its environmental variables, and you will need to download a couple of Python packages, specifically pyserial and the rpisoc package.

:Note:

	This has only been tested for Windows 7 and Windows 8. Theoretically everything should work on OS X and of course Linux, but this has not yet been tested.


Installing the RPiSoC device driver
-----------------------------------
The details of this step will depend on your Operating System. For Windows 7, the process is relatively easy. The driver which ultimately must be installed is `this one <https://github.com/EmbeditElectronics/psoc_2_pi/blob/master/PSoC%20Creator/USBUART_cdc.inf>`_

:Windows 7:

	When you connect your RPiSoC to a USB port on your PC, it will try to find a driver to install. Of course, it will fail because you need to manually provide it the driver.
		
	- Open your Device Manager
	- In "Other Devices" you should see *RPiSoC* with an exclamation sign next to it, indicating that it is an unknown device
	- Right click on *RPiSoC* and choose **Properties**
	- On the *General* tab, there should be an option for **Update Driver...** If this option is not available, disconnect and reconnect the device.
	- Click **Update Driver...**
	- Choose **Browse my computer for driver software**
	- Now, simply provide the address bar with the folder that contains the driver linked above
	- If the driver cannot be found, make sure that the driver is saved as a .inf
	- Once the driver is found, it will warn you that the driver cannot be verified. Simply choose to install the driver anyway.
	
	
:Windows 8:

	The final steps will be the same as above, but there are preliminary steps that must be taken. You must disable driver signature verification so that you are able to install unsigned drivers. This will require a couple of restarts. A good guide on this procedure is shown `in this SparkFun tutorial <https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/disabling-driver-signature-on-windows-8/disabling-signed-driver-enforcement-on-windows-8>`_

With the driver successfully installed on your system as *Cypress USB UART* you can move onto the next step

Installing Python
-----------------
On OS X and Linux, Python comes preinstalled. For Windows it does not, and so it must be downloaded and installed. 

- Navigate to the `release page for Python 2.7.8 <https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8/>`_ and scroll down to the **Download** section
- Choose the appropriate installer for your Operating system. 
	* For 32 bit Windows systems choose *Windows x86 MSI Installer (2.7.8)*
	* For 64 bit Windows systems choose *Windows X86-64 MSI Installer (2.7.8)*
- During installation, make sure Python is installed to :code:`C:\Python27`

Edit Windows path variables to include Python
---------------------------------------------
This step will allow you to call python and any packages you might have installed without having to explicitly provide their paths.  This process will be slightly different between Windows 7 and 8

:Windows 7:

	- Right click on **Computer** and select **Properties**
	
:Windows 8:

	- Press **Windows key + C** to bring up your charms panel. 
	- Navigate to *Settings* and then *Control Panel*
	- Then, select *Systems and Security* then *System*
	
From here, the steps are identical.

- To the left, there will be a toolbar called *Control Panel Home*
	* In this toolbar, select **Advanced system settings**
- In the *Advanced* tab, select **Environmental Variables...**
- In the console window on the bottom, labeled *System variables*, scroll to the variable **PATH** and select **Edit**
- In the *Variable value* window, scroll to the very end and enter the following text exactly :code:`;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts`

To test this, restart your computer, then open the windows command prompt, and type :code:`python`. If everything so far has been successful, this will launch the python interpreter in your console window.

Install required packages
-------------------------
For your PC, there is only one third party package apart from our own that is required- pyserial. You must install this and the rpisoc package to use the API.

- pyserials installer can be found on their `PyPi page <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyserial>`_. Simply navigate to this page and choose to download *pyserial-2.7.win32.exe (md5)*. When the download completes, run the .exe that is downloaded and follow the on screen instructions. 
- Next, you must install the rpisoc package. The process will be very similar to the above. The rpisoc installers are located `on our github <https://github.com/EmbeditElectronics/psoc_2_pi/tree/master/API_Python/dist>`_. Simply download the one which corresponds to your operating system (64-bit vs 32-bit), and then run the .exe when it has downloaded.

Using the API
-------------
Of course, you will need to download an appropriate IDE to begin writing your python scripts, but which one you use is up to you. The only difference between this code and your Raspberry Pi code will be in the construction of the :class:`rpisoc.RPiSoC` object. 
Here, the following two lines should always be at the top of your scripts::

	from rpisoc import *
	RPiSoC('SERIAL', DEBUG = True)

To test that everything is working:

- Plug your RPiSoC into your PC using a USB cable
- Run any of `these <https://github.com/EmbeditElectronics/psoc_2_pi/tree/master/API_Python/examples>`_ scripts
	* To run any script, either open it using python (double clicking it will work if it opens using python by default), or navigate to the directory containing the script with you command prompt and enter :code:`python script_name.py`. So to run *blinky.py* from the examples, navigate to the *examples* folder in your command prompt and enter :code:`python blinky.py` into the console
	

.. _getting-started-mods:

Changing communication protocol used by the API
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
By default, the API uses Serial for convenience of PC usage. To change this to SPI or I2C (which can only be used on the Raspberry Pi of course), it is designed to be very simple, so don't fret!

On the Python Side, simply change your initialization of the RPiSoC object from::

	RPiSoC('SERIAL') 

so that it instead reads:: 

	RPiSoC('SPI')

or::

	RPiSoC('I2C')

Now, in the PSoC Creator program navigate to *mem1.h* and you will find three lines that look like this:

.. code-block:: c

	//#define USE_SPI                     // KEEP THIS UNCOMMENTED TO USE SPI -- COMMENT THE OTHER PROTOCOLS!! 
	//#define USE_I2C                     // KEEP THIS UNCOMMENTED TO USE I2C -- COMMENT THE OTHER PROTOCOLS!! 
	#define USE_SERIAL                    // KEEP THIS UNCOMMENTED TO USE SERIAL -- COMMENT THE OTHER PROTOCOLS!!

This of course indicates that Serial is to be used. To change this, simply change which protocols are commented out. For instance, to change to SPI, you would replace those lines with:

.. code-block:: c

	#define USE_SPI                     // KEEP THIS UNCOMMENTED TO USE SPI -- COMMENT THE OTHER PROTOCOLS!! 
	//#define USE_I2C                   // KEEP THIS UNCOMMENTED TO USE I2C -- COMMENT THE OTHER PROTOCOLS!! 
	//#define USE_SERIAL                // KEEP THIS UNCOMMENTED TO USE SERIAL -- COMMENT THE OTHER PROTOCOLS!!	

Now, the firmware will compile itself so that SPI will be used. 
But, you will still need to have the SPI and I2C components included in your schematic file. To do this:

- Navigate to the *.cysch* page of your workspace, and go to the *COMMUNICATIONS* tab
- Here delete the USB component, and replace it with either the SPI or I2C component, depending on which you intend to use.
- For SPI, make sure to choose *SPI Slave Full Duplex mode Macro v2.60* from the component catalog.
- For I2C, choose *I2C Slave (UDB) v3.30* make sure, to delete the *RST_1* pin, and wire it to a *Logic Low 0* component instead.
- Navigate to your design wide resources page (*.cydwr*) to give pin assignments to your new pins
- For SPI:
	* Assign *MISO_1* to P1[3]
	* Assign *MOSI_1* to P1[4]
	* Assign *SCLK_1* to P1[1]
- For I2C:
	* Assign *SDA_1* to P1[6]
	* Assign *SCL_1* to P1[7]

Now just compile the program, and redownload it to the RPiSoC using the Bootloader Host Tool.
